ReactJS is the library(contains in built functionalities) of Javascript.

ReactJS is all about components(component based architecture).
components -> Reusable piece of Code.(components is nothing but a function, which creates custom HTML elemnet).

Why ReactJS ?
Js follow imperative approach(makes the code complex and longer) & reactJS solve this problem by using Declaritive approach.
Reusability
DRY approach [Don't repeat yourself]
SOC [Separation of Concert], Maintainability.

SPA -> [Single Page Application] i.e -> Netflix etc.

<-----------------------------ADD TAILWIND--------------------------------------->
Certainly! Adding Tailwind CSS to your React project is a great way to quickly style your components. Let's get started! ðŸ˜Š

Here are a few different approaches you can take to set up Tailwind CSS in your React project:

1. **Using Create React App (CRA)**:
   If you're starting a new project with Create React App, follow these steps:

   - Create your project using CRA (if you haven't already):
     ```bash
     npx create-react-app my-project
     cd my-project
     ```

   - Install Tailwind CSS via npm:
     ```bash
     npm install -D tailwindcss
     ```

   - Generate your `tailwind.config.js` file:
     ```bash
     npx tailwindcss init
     ```

   - Configure your template paths in `tailwind.config.js`:
     ```javascript
     // tailwind.config.js
     module.exports = {
       content: [
         "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
       ],
       theme: {
         extend: {},
       },
       plugins: [],
     };
     ```

   - Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS (in `./src/index.css`):
     ```css
     @tailwind base;
     @tailwind components;
     @tailwind utilities;
     ```

   - Start your build process:
     ```bash
     npm run start
     ```

   Now you can use Tailwind's utility classes to style your content in your React components! For example, in `App.js`:
   ```jsx
   export default function App() {
     return (
       <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold underline">Hello, world!</h1>
     );
   }
